## 🎯 Customization

###Fonts
The projects uses Apple's SF PRO font

### Colors
The project uses a custom color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js`:

\`\`\`javascript
colors: {
  blue: "#2997FF",
  "custom-gray": "#AEB1C3",
  "custom-blue": "#0065cc",
  "custom-purple": "#708DFA",
  "custom-pink": "#D464AE",
  // ... more colors
}
\`\`\`

### 3D Models
To customize iPhone colors, modify the color arrays in `src/assets/constrant/index.js`:

\`\`\`javascript
export const models = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "iPhone 16 in Ultramarine",
    color: ["#5c6ab4", "#4053a6", "#232b7e", "#4268c3"],
  },
  // more color variants
];
\`\`\`

### Animations
GSAP animations can be customized in individual components. Key animation utilities are in `src/assets/utils/Animation.js`.
